  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    auto lr = LineReader(".history_file");

    while (lr) {
      auto cmd = lr.readline(prompt);
      if (!cmd.empty()) {
        // parse and execute the command string.
        // ...
      }
    }
    std::cout << '\n' << "Bye!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
  }
#+end_src
