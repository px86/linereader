#+TITLE: LineReader - something like GNU readline, but in C++
#+AUTHOR: Pushkar Raj

* About

=LineReader= let's you edit commands on the command line. It is very handy when implementing a REPL e.g. an interactive shell.

* Usage

Currently the library is compiled into a relocatable =obj= file and then compiled together with your project. However things might change soon. I am planning to make this a header only library.

To use =LineReader= in you project,

#+begin_src cpp
  #include "linereader.hpp"
  #include <iostream>

  int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    auto lr = LineReader();
    auto str = lr.readline(">>> ");
    std::cout << "\n LineReader returned: " << str << '\n';
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

* Shortcuts

Basic Emacs like movement keys are supported. For example, =C-b=, =C-f=, =C-d=, =C-p= and =C-n=.

* Notes

- Terminal escape sequences have been tested on =xterm= only.
- Will not work on non-POSIX systems.
